# Yellowjacket-Public

The public repo for our Game Off Game Jam 2021 submission.

Our working repo was kept private, as it contained paid assets we are not licensed to share (and we forgot to add some to the gitignore before they were pushed...)

We have provided a list of our commits from the private repo, for verification's sake.

## Yellowjacket

**YellowJacket** is a metroidvania game with hand-drawn artwork. It was created in the month of November 2021 for the Game Off Game Jam.
